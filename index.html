            <p>
                Rishabh began his journey over <strong>13 years ago</strong>, developing mobile apps with <strong>Objectice-C</strong>, and later <strong>Swift</strong>, and later <strong>Kotlin & React Native</strong>. He led teams to create <strong>great applications</strong>, like the <strong>McDonald's App</strong>, which reached the <strong>#1 spot in Germany</strong> with a <strong>4.5+ rating on iTunes</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                But he didn‚Äôt stop there. He built a <strong>Video calling app</strong>, and later created <strong>low-code mobile platform</strong> enabling non-technical users to design fully functional apps with minimal effort.

                <em>"For Rishabh, every app isn‚Äôt just a product ‚Äî it‚Äôs a blueprint brought to life, one line of code at a time."</em>
